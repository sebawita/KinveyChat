# Conditions

Sometimes when you work on a chatbot conversation, you need extra control over the flow of the conversation. 
Some steps should be executed only in specific cases (or skipped in specific cases).

For example: the chatbot could ask users if they have a discount-code. If the user says yes, then it should ask for the discount-code. If the user says no, then it should skip the discount-code question.

The above scenario can be achieved in two steps:

1. A **confirmation** step - which asks the user a **Yes**/**No** question:

  ```json
  {
      "type": "confirmation",
      "entity": "hasCode",
      "messages": [
        "Do you have a Discount Code?"
      ]
  },
  ```

2. A **question** step with a `conditions` array - which only shows if `hasCode` is true:

  ```json
  {
      "type": "question",
      "entity": "discount-code",
      "entity-type": "",
      "messages": [
        "What is your Discount Code?"
      ],
      "conditions": [
        "{{hasCode}}"
      ]
  }
  ```

## Validation

Conditions can also be used with custom validators, where you can provide a set of expressions to check if the provided user input is valid.
For example, you might not want your users to order more than 5 tickets.

```json
{
  "type": "question",
  "entity": "tickets",
  "entity-type": "Number",
  "messages": [
    "How many tickets would you like?"
  ],
  "reactions": {
    "validations": [
      {
        "type": "custom",
        "parameters": {
          "condition": "{{$lt tickets 6}}"
        },
        "error-message": [
          "Sorry, but you can't buy more than 5 tickets."
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Conditional Operators

There are a number of very useful operators that you could use.

### Operator `$not`

The `$not` operator is a simple negation operator, that changes true to false, and false to true.

Following on the initial **Discount Code** example, you could use it to show a different message when `hasCode` is `false`.

You could do this like this:

```json
{
  "type": "question",
  "entity": "discount-code",
  "messages": [
    "You could sign up to our newsletters to receive a discount code next month."
  ],
  "conditions": [
    "{{$not hasCode}}"
  ]
}
```

### Comparison operators

You could also use a comparison operator to complete the same scenario, and check if:

* `hasCode` **equals** `false`, like this:

```json
"{{$eq hasCode false}}"
```

* `hasCode` **not equals** `true`, like this:

```json
"{{$ne hasCode true}}"
```

Here is a list of available comparison operators.

* `$eq` - equals
* `$gt` - greater than
* `$gte` - greater or equal
* `$lt` - less than
* `$lte` - less or equal
* `$ne` - not equal

### Operator `$in`

The `$in` operator allows you to check if a value is present in an array.

```json
"{{$in myValue myArray}}"
```

### Boolean `$and` `$or`

You can also use `$and` and `$or` to build more complex conditions, like this:

```json
"{{$and (condition 1) (condition 2)}}"
```

For example when a price should be **less than 20**, but also it should be a **positive number**:

```json
"{{$and  ($lt price 20) ($gt price 0) }}"
```

### Operator `$has`

The `$has` operator allows you to check if a specific entity has been provided by a user. This operator comes in handy in many scenarios.

#### Skip Parent Question

The `$has` operator comes in handy when looking up an entity requires a two (or more) step process. 

For example, in order to find a city, the chatbot asks for a country first, and then based on the country it provides a list of cities. However, if the user already provided the city, then it would be good to skip the country step.

Please, note that the **value of the country** is used in the validation of the city. So, the city validation should also be updated, so that it only check the `city.country` when country has been provided.

Follow these steps to update the `rent-car` conversation:

1. Find the `country` question step
2. Add a `conditions` array => start typing **co** and select `conditions`
3. Add the following condition => `"{{$not ($has city)}}"`
4. Find the `city` question step
5. Update `Validations->parameters->condition`

  You need to use an `$or` operator where:
  *  either country is not provided => `($not ($has country))`
  *  or the city.country is the same as the provided country => `($eq city.country country)`

  Like this:

  ```json
"condition": "{{$or ($not ($has country)) ($eq city.country country)}}"
```

  <!--
```json
"condition": "{{$eq  ($has country) ($eq city.country country)}}"
```
-->

##### Test

Save and test the `rent-car` conversation.

Try the following conversations:

1. Send: *I want to rent a car from today to tomorrow*
2. Send: *Berlin*
3. You should be asked to choose a car
4. Select a car
5. Send: *I want to rent a car from today to tomorrow in France* 
6. Send: *Berlin*
7. You should be shown an error message
8. Send: *Paris*
9. You should be asked to choose a car
10. Select a car
