## Intro

In the last few years, voice assistants changed the way we interact with our devices. To some, this was a somewhat strange experience, but many more felt that this was a more natural way of interacting with most services provided by our phones and computers.

Many companies took this as an opportunity to enhance the experience for their customers and provided some of their core functionality via a set of voice commands, thus becoming more customer-friendly and strengthening their brand.

Voice chatbots are not only popular because of the convenience of talking to a device, but also they come very *handy*, when your hands are busy (i.e. when you are cooking ) or more importantly when your eyes should be *focused* elsewhere (i.e. when you are driving).

In this article, you will learn how to build your own voice assistant. You will use [Kinvey Chat](https://www.progress.com/kinvey/chat) to build an **Alexa skill** in a few easy steps.



## Scenarios

To build something worthwhile we need a *"real"* customer and a set of *"real"* scenarios.

A telecommunications company called **C-Mobile** provides various services to its customers. They identified a need to assist their pay-as-you-go customers with various services around topping up their accounts and buying data packages.



### Scenario #1 â€” check my balance

As a customer, I want to be able to ask my Alexa device to check my balance.

Alexa should respond with the amount of credit I have left on my account together with the remaining minutes, texts and data.



### Scenario #2 â€” top-up

As a customer, I want to be able to top up my account.

Alexa should guide me through the required steps, provide with a list of options, and at the end provide the updated credit on the account.



### Scenario #3 â€” buy a data package

As a customer, I want to be able to buy additional data packages.

Alexa should guide me through the required steps, provide me with a list of data packages, which should be paid for with the credits on the account.



### Assumptions / simplification of the scenario

Usually, when you build applications for services like this, you will have a functionality that allows your user to log in to their specific account. In the case of voice assistants, this usually is handled through the admin portal, which then automatically associates the user account with their app.

This is a whole topic on its own, which I am planning to cover in another blog post. Instead, I will ask you to hardcode the user id in the project.

### API

**C-Mobiles** provides you with a very simple API, which allows you to manage individual accounts.

You can access all of the calls from the following https://demoapis.com/cmobile/<function-name>:

Please note that all API calls expect an **id** parameter. Please pick one number 9-11 digits long, and use it for all of your calls. This way when you top up an account and then ask for the account status, you will see the balance updated.

Also, if you happen to use a number that someone else is also using (this is not very likely unless you use the demo id), just pick a different number and you should be fine.

Here is the list of available functions:

### getAccountStatus

`getAccountStatus` allows you to ask for the Account balance, minutes, SMS, and data.

**Signature:**

```
/availableCards/:id
```

You need to provide your selected account **id**.

**Example:**

Here is an example of how to get the account balance for id **012345678**

[https://demoapis.com/cmobile/getAccountStatus/012345678](https://demoapis.com/cmobile/getAccountStatus/012345678)

**Result:**

```json
{
  "balance": 12,
  "minutes": 100,
  "SMS": 200,
  "data": 29
}
```



### topUp

`topUp` allows you to top up your account balance, as a result, the balance will increase and you will receive an updated account status.

**Signature:**

```
/topUp/:id?val={amount}&card={4-digits}
```

You need to provide your selected account **id**.

Additionally, you need to provide two query params:

- `val` â€” with the amount you want to top up
- `card` â€” last 4 digits of the card to use, this param is not really used for anything, but it is here to simulate the scenario.

**Example:**

Here is an example of how to top the account id **012345678** with **10** credits using the card ending with **9876** (*don't worry no card payment will actually happen* ðŸ˜‰).

[https://demoapis.com/cmobile/topUp/012345678?val=10&card=9876](https://demoapis.com/cmobile/topUp/012345678?val=10&card=9876)

**Result:**

```json
{
  "balance": 22,
  "minutes": 100,
  "SMS": 200,
  "data": 29
}
```



### availableCards/:id

`availableCads` allows you to look up all associated payment cards with the account.

**Signature:**

```
/availableCards/:id
```

You need to provide your selected account **id**.

**Example:**

Here is an example of how to check what payment cards are associated with the account id **012345678**.

[https://demoapis.com/cmobile/availableCards/012345678](https://demoapis.com/cmobile/availableCards/012345678)

**Result:**

```json
{
  "balance": 22,
  "minutes": 100,
  "SMS": 200,
  "data": 29
}
```



### resetAccount

`resetAccount` allows you to reset your account. This can come useful when you want to start from scratch.

**Signature:**

```
/resetAccount/:id
```

You need to provide your selected account **id**.

**Example:**

Here is an example of how to reset the account id **012345678**.

[https://demoapis.com/cmobile/resetAccount/012345678](https://demoapis.com/cmobile/resetAccount/012345678)

**Result:**

```json
{
  "balance": 12,
  "minutes": 100,
  "SMS": 200,
  "data": 29
}
```



### showDataPackages

`showDataPackages` allows you to view available data packages for you to purchase.

For each package you will receive a name, amount of data in GB and MB, and a price.

**Signature:**

```
/showDataPackages
```

No parameters are required.

**Example:**

Here is an example of how to view available data packages.

[https://demoapis.com/cmobile/showDataPackages](https://demoapis.com/cmobile/showDataPackages)

**Result:**

```json
[
  {
    "name": "lite",
    "dataGB": 0.5,
    "dataMB": 512,
    "price": 7
  },
  {
    "name": "small",
    "dataGB": 1,
    "dataMB": 1024,
    "price": 10
  },
  {
    "name": "medium",
    "dataGB": 3,
    "dataMB": 3072,
    "price": 20
  },
  {
    "name": "big",
    "dataGB": 5,
    "dataMB": 5120,
    "price": 25
  }
]
```



### buyData

`buyData` allows you to purchase more data for your account. As a result, more data will be added to the account, and the price of the package will be deducted from the balance.

**Signature:**

```
/buyData/:id?dataPack={name}
```

You need to provide your selected account **id**.

Additionally, you need to provide a query param `dataPack` with the name of the package that you want to purchase.

**Example:**

Here is an example of how to buy a **medium** data pack for the account id **012345678**.

[https://demoapis.com/cmobile/buyData/012345678?dataPack=medium](https://demoapis.com/cmobile/buyData/012345678?dataPack=medium)

**Result:**

```json
[
  {
    "name": "lite",
    "dataGB": 0.5,
    "dataMB": 512,
    "price": 7
  },
  {
    "name": "small",
    "dataGB": 1,
    "dataMB": 1024,
    "price": 10
  },
  {
    "name": "medium",
    "dataGB": 3,
    "dataMB": 3072,
    "price": 20
  },
  {
    "name": "big",
    "dataGB": 5,
    "dataMB": 5120,
    "price": 25
  }
]
```



## The flow of the tutorial

We will tackle this project in two rounds.

- **Phase 1** â€” Getting Started â€” You will build a smart part of the conversation (scenario: *Check my balance* ) and then test it as part of an Alexa skill. This part focuses mostly on making sure that your environment is set up correctly, and on getting some response from an Alexa Skill.
- **Phase 2** â€” Add more conversations â€” You will add the remaining conversations. This part focuses more on managing the conversation flow and completing the provided scenarios.



## Phase 1 â€” Getting started

The getting started is as simple as 1,2,3, which can be done in these really easy steps.

#### Step 1 â€” Create a Kinvey Chat project

First, you need to sign in to [Kinvey Chat Console](https://bots.kinvey.com/). 

>  If you don't have an account yet, you can create it [here](https://console.kinvey.com/sign-up). Don't worry, you can get started for free.



After you sign in you can create a new chatbot. <br />Press the **[+ New bot]** button:

<img src="./img/new-bot.png?raw=true" width="400">

Call the project **cmobile**.

Keep the **Bot Language** as **English**, and **Start with** as **Blank bot**.

Press the **[Create]** button.

<img src="./img/new-bot-config.png?raw=true" width="400">

This will create a simple chatbot, with a couple of super basic conversations.



#### Testing

To test it, press the **[Test]** button. Then when the chatbot loads:

- type: *hi*
- the chatbot should respond with a welcome message
- click one of the buttons or type: *Conversation 1*
- the chatbot should respond with something like: *This is conversation 1*



#### Step 2 â€” Create your first conversation â€” check my balance

Now that you have a working chatbot, it is time for you to implement the first conversation, which is for the **check my balance** scenario.

When the user says *"Check my balance"*, the chatbot should call the `getAccountStatus` function, and then print out the message with the status returned from the API.



Are you ready? Let's go.



**Add a new conversation** 

In the **Cognitive Flow** tab (which is the tab you arrive by default), on the right hand side there is a list of all conversations in this project. Click on the **conversationTwo**, which will take you to that conversation.

At the end of the `json` containing `conversationTwo` add a comma, and in the new line start typing `con`, this should trigger a little pop-up with a list of code snippets.

>  The code snippets are really useful in the process of constructing your chatbot, as they help you generate the JSON in the correct format, plus they save you a lot of time.

Select the `conversation-goal` snippet and press enter. This should output the following code:

```json
"conversation-name": {
  "type": "goal",
  "steps": [

  ]
}
```



Change `"conversation-name"` to `"check-my-balance"`.



**Add a response message  to the convesration**

Next you need to add a **message** step to the conversation.

> Hint: If you press **tab**, the cursor will jump inside the `steps[ ]` array.



From inside the `steps[ ]` array, start typing `step` (or `stme` for *step message*) and select the `step-message` snippet. This should produce the following code:

```json
{
  "type": "message",
    "messages": [
      "Your message"
  ]
}
```

Change `"Your message"` to `"I am checking your balance"` .

The `check-my-balance` conversation should look like this:

```json
"check-my-balance": {
  "type": "goal",
  "steps": [
    {
      "type": "message",
      "messages": [
        "I am checking your balance"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```



**Here is how to do it:**

<img src="./img/check-my-balance-1.gif?raw=true">



**Train the chatbot to know when to use your new conversation**

Next, you need to train the chatbot to understand when to trigger this conversation.

Navigate to the **Training** tab, click on **Conversation built-in**, and then press the **[Add value]** button.

Set the `value` to `"check-my-balance"` â€” this how the chatbot engine knows which conversation to trigger

Add the following expressions `expressions` â€” this how you tell the chatbot engine, when to trigger this conversation:

- *Check my balance*
- *What is my balance?*

Press the **[Save]** button.



**Test**

To test this new conversation, press the **[Test]** button, and type: *"Check my balance"*.

The chatbot should respond with your message.



**Here is how to do it:**

<img src="./img/check-my-balance-2.gif?raw=true">



**Update the conversation to return the account status**

Now that you have the conversation working, it is time to change it so that it returns *real* data.



**Update the conversation to call the API and print a message**

Remove the message step, so that the `"steps": [ ]` array is empty.

Start typing `stwe` and select `step-webhook`. Remove all the properties in the `data-source`, but keep the `endpoint`.

Update `endpoint` to `"https://demoapis.com/cmobile/getAccountStatus/012345678"`

> Note: please use a different id instead of **012345678**, or you might be clashing with other people using the same number.

Add an `"entity"` property (it is best to place it below `"type": "webhook",`) and call it `"status"` â€” the result of the API call will be stored in `status`.

Finally, you need to add a `"messages"` property to this step, which will contain the message to be printed when the API returns the result, like this:

```
"messages": [
  "Let's have a look at your account. You have {{status.balance}} dollars left."
]
```



> Hint: You could also, make the response multiline â€” which is not very important with voice chatbots, as chatbots tend to read the whole output, as one line, but it looks better when we test it in the console.
>
> To add a multiline response, we need to use an array of arrays.
>
> Here are two examples:
>
> **One Array**
>
> ```json
> "messages": [
>   "Line 1",
>   "Line 2",
>   "Line 3"
> ]
> ```
>
> This will result in one of the lines printed (or spoken) at random.
>
> **Two Arrays**
>
> ```json
> "messages": [
>   [
>     "Line 1",
>     "Line 2",
>     "Line 3"
>   ]
> ]
> ```
>
> This will result in all of the lines printed (or spoken).



Here are `messages` containing all of the data returned from the `getAccountStatus` API call:

```
"messages": [
  [
    "Let's have a look at your account. You have:",
    "{{$currency status.balance 'USD'}}",
    "{{status.minutes}} minutes, {{status.SMS}} text messages",
    "and {{status.data}} megabytes left"
  ]
]
```



The whole `check-my-balance` conversation should look like this:

```json
"check-my-balance": {
  "type": "goal",
  "steps": [
    {
      "type": "webhook",
      "entity": "status",
      "data-source": {
        "endpoint": "https://demoapis.com/cmobile/getAccountStatus/012345678"
      },
      "messages": [
        [
          "Let's have a look at your account. You have:",
          "{{$currency status.balance 'USD'}}",
          "{{status.minutes}} minutes, {{status.SMS}} text messages",
          "and {{status.data}} megabytes left"
        ]
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```



**Test**

To test this new conversation, press the **[Test]** button, and type: *"What is my balance?"*.

The chatbot should respond with your message.



**Here is how to do it:**

<img src="./img/check-my-balance-3.gif?raw=true">



**(Optional) Tidy up the initial messages**

Before you move on, it is a good idea to tidy up the initial messages.

Your chatbot project has 3 support conversations:

- `welcome` â€” this conversation is triggered when you start talking with your chatbot. This conversation triggers the `help` conversation.
- `help` â€” this conversation is triggered when the chatbot believes that you might need help
- `restart` â€” this conversation is triggered when you type/say *"restart"*. This conversation triggers the `welcome` conversation



**Update the welcome message**

Find the `welcome` conversation and change: `"This is a welcome conversation for your chatbot"` text to `"Welcome to the c-mobile self service."`

**Update the help message and the list of proposed actions**

Find the `help` conversation and remove the line `"If you get stuck, you can always restart our conversation by typing 'restart'",`. This way the intro conversation will be a lot shorter.

Additionally, you should change the `display` options from `"Conversation 1", "Conversation 2"` to `"Check my balance", "Top up", "Buy data"` . You will implement `Top up` and `Buy data` later, but it is good to already have these options.

Your `welcome` and `help` conversations should look like this:

```json
"welcome": {
  "type": "support",
  "steps": [
    {
      "type": "message",
      "messages": [
        "Welcome to the c-mobile self-service."
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "conversation",
      "conversation": "help",
      "conditions": [
        "{{$not ($has conversation) }}"
      ]
    }
  ]
},
"help": {
  "type": "support",
  "steps": [
    {
      "type": "message",
      "messages": [
        [
          "Here is what I can do for you:"
        ]
      ],
      "display": {
        "type": "quick-reply",
        "data": [
          "Check my balance",
          "Top up",
          "Buy data"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
},
```

**Test**

To test this new configuration, press the **[Test]** button, and type: *"Hi"*



#### Step 3 â€” Deploy to Alexa

- Configure Amazon Alexa account and create a new chatbot
  - Use proxy to test your chatbot
- Use Alexa dev console
